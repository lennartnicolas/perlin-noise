# Perlin Noise in C++

p5.js's Perlin noise implementation converted to C++ code. The noise() function behaves exactly the same although you need to construct an object in C++ to use it.
NoiseSeed(seed) changes the seed of the LCG from C++'s STL. You may use different PRNGs for different results.

Reference Implementation:

## Sounds with Perlin Noise (WIP)
The Perlin-Noise directory contains a JUCE project with a wavetable oscillator  playing back a wavetable generated by Perlin noise. The GUI displays the corresponding wavetable (interface for controlling parameters not implemented yet).
